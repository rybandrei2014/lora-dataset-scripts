# Scripts for LORA dataset preparation

Repo contains two utility scripts to ease resizing and captioning of LORA dataset:
- `caption.py` uses `ollama` to caption dataset
- `resize.py` resizes all image to specific resolutions

Inputs should be put in `input` folder, the outputs will be available in `output` folder.
